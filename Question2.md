# Question 2: Project Explanation

I worked in the frontend development of company's own website development project. In this project, I had to make many webpages of the website using HTML, CSS. For this, I used twig template, sass to reuse the code and make simple changes. The BEM(BLock, Element, Modifier) methodology was mostly used to arrange CSS classes. And git to keep track of the process in the project and sharing the changes among the developers and the team.
