# Question 10: Memory Allocation in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

Memory Allocation is a fundamental concept in OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It describes how and where memory is allocated to store objects. Objects are instances of class.
There are two types of memory allocation

Static Memory Allocation: It occurs at compile time. It is fixed and cannot be resized. The amount of memory is known before the program execution begins. This memory is allocated for global variables, static variables and constants

Dynamic Memory Allocation: It occurs at runtime. It can be resized and deallocated. The memory is allocated as needed. This memory is allocated for arrays with variable sizes, linked lists.
